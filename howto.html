        <p>This small webapp was designed to provide a reference point for prices and 4C parameters of diamonds.
The data was taken from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html" class="code">ggplot2</a> package.</p>
<p>In order to compare the diamond of your selection with multiple reference diamonds in the database:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select weight</li>
<li>Choose your price range</li>
<li>Toggle the clarity and cut that you find acceptable</li>
<li>Compare the price!</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you decide to hover over a selected point, it will display the precise information abou the selected diamond. Also, you can change axis and fill color in the panel under the plot.</p>
